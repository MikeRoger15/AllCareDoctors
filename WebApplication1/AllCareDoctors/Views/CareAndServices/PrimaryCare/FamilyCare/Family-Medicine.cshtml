        Family medicine is a branch of primary care medicine designed to treat men,
        <br/>women, and children of all ages. <br/> <br/>
        Family practice differs from internal medicine by treating a wider <br/>
        range of patients, as family medicine providers <br/>
        receive training in several medical specialties to diagnose and treat many conditions. <br/><br/>

    <p class="intro-text">
        At AllCare Doctors Physicians, our board-certified family medicine providers offer regular check-ups,
        preventive care, and can oversee treatment from multiple specialists. Family medicine providers are trained
        to diagnose and treat a range of conditions, including:
    </p>

    <ul class="condition-list">
        <li>- Preventive care</li>
        <li>- Vaccinations</li>
        <li>- Immunization and screening tests</li>
        <li>- Healthy lifestyle counseling</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="intro-text">
        Many family medicine providers undergo additional education and training in order to specialize in areas such as
        pediatrics, geriatrics, sports medicine, and other fields. Patients should see a family medicine provider
        to manage their health, receive regular tests and screenings, and learn preventive care methods.
